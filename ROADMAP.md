# ROADMAP

- [ ] Print error messages for Human.
- [ ] Report line num & col.
- [ ] Support partial source: P4_SetSourceContentSlice(s, i, j).
- [ ] Reset source so it can be re-parsed.
- [ ] P4_Inspect(tok, bool (f) (tok)). Example: https://golang.org/pkg/go/ast/#Inspect.
- [ ] Run in VERBOSE mode.
- [ ] Add traverse functions for Tokens.
- [ ] New Expression Kind: Numeric.
- [ ] New Expression Kind: CharacterSet.
- [ ] New Expression Kind: Complement.
- [ ] New Expression Kind: Panic.
- [ ] New Expression Kind: Function.
- [ ] New Expression Kind: Sub Grammar.
- [ ] Performance optimization: pre-alloc tokens.
- [ ] Token only have expr id, no expr.
- [ ] Register a optional name function to convert rule id to rule names.
- [ ] Stop on first error v/s Recover from Panic.
- [ ] Allow replacing malloc/free functions.
- [ ] New Source Flag: Support UTF-8 BOM sequence (0xEF 0xBB 0xBF) at the start of source.
- [ ] Python Binding: example: cffi, misaka.
- [ ] Benchmark: example: json-c. `valgrind --tool=massif --massif-out-file=massif.out ./build/tests/test_example_json && ms_print massif.out ms_print.out`.
- [ ] Cache literal len.
- [ ] backrefs is not necessary if there is no BackReference in Sequence.
- [ ] static lib.
- [ ] A python grammar.
- [ ] A binary executable for display parsed results in JSON output. The executable can support general programming languages, such as Mustache, Python, JSON, YAML, etc. Some other programs can then takes the input from stdin and do some fancy work. `peppapeg --lang=py38 source.py`
- [ ] Add tutorials (json, mustache, ini) in docs.
- [ ] Add how-to guides in docs.
- [ ] Add explanations in docs.
- [ ] Enable AddressSanitizer. Example: cJSON.
- [ ] RequireVersion.
- [ ] GetErrorString.
- [ ] Except (Any but).
- [ ] Any.
- [ ] Until.

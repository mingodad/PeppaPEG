# ROADMAP

- [ ] api: operate slice (copy string, get size, etc).
- [ ] api: operate node.
- [ ] api: set source verbose mode.
- [ ] api: save backreference in source stack so it can be used outside a sequence.
- [ ] api: until.
- [ ] api: Sanitize `\0` to whitespace for the source input, this happens in creating the source/setting the source size. Example: Python Parser.
- [ ] api: support UTF-8 BOM sequence (0xEF 0xBB 0xBF) at the start of source.
- [ ] api: register a function for matching source. This should help dealing with some inputs difficult to parse.
- [ ] api: add `expect_rule_id`, instead of saving `errmsg`.
- [ ] peg: numeric.
- [ ] peg: panic.
- [ ] peg: rule template.
- [ ] peg: sub grammar.
- [ ] peg: left recursive: https://tratt.net/laurie/research/pubs/html/tratt__direct_left_recursive_parsing_expression_grammars/ https://github.com/orlandohill/peg-left-recursion. introduce @left_recursion, @right_recursion in sequence.
- [ ] peg: support Python-style INDENT rule.
- [ ] peg: describe grammar AST using ADSL-style rules.
- [ ] perf: pre-alloc tokens.
- [ ] perf: Cache literal len.
- [ ] perf: backrefs is not necessary if there is no BackReference in Sequence.
- [ ] perf: trace: add a tracer in P4_Source. When matching, annotate the tracer. An additional tool can aggregate data and output a DOT / compile to png.
- [ ] perf: tracer: https://pegjs.org/documentation

- [ ] tests: benchmark: example: json-c. `valgrind --tool=massif --massif-out-file=massif.out ./build/tests/test_example_json && ms_print massif.out ms_print.out`.
- [ ] tests: enable AddressSanitizer. Example: cJSON.
- [ ] tests: add a fuzzy testing framework.
- [ ] lang: python grammar.
- [ ] lang: ES6 grammar: https://www.ecma-international.org/wp-content/uploads/ECMA-262_6th_edition_june_2015.pdf
- [ ] lang: zig grammar: https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#Grammar
- [ ] lang: awk grammar: https://github.com/onetrueawk/awk/blob/master/lex.c https://github.com/onetrueawk/awk/blob/master/awkgram.y
- [ ] lang: sql grammar: https://tomassetti.me/parsing-sql/
- [ ] lang: A binary executable for display parsed results in JSON output. The executable can support general programming languages, such as Mustache, Python, JSON, YAML, etc. Some other programs can then takes the input from stdin and do some fancy work. `p4 cst source.py`, `p4 ast source.py`.
- [ ] pratt parser: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator-precedence_parser
- [ ] build: static lib.
